# A Emacs config

This is my emacs configuration tree, continually used.

## Installation

To install, clone this repo to `~/.emacs.d`, i.e. ensure that the
`init.el` contained in this repo ends up at `~/.emacs.d/init.el`.
Upon starting up Emacs for the first time, further third-party
packages will be automatically downloaded and installed.
